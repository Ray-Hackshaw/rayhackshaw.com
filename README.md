My own personal website - acting as a versatile landing site and link tree for easy access to all of my resources and work.
Currently in the process of redesigning, with a basic foundation already underway. My goals are to introduce more content via the Education History pages and add more descriptive item collections to each record. 
I also would like to experiment with a frosted/blurred bordered background in the near future.
